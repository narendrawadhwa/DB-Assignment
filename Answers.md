1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.

Ans. The "Product" entity establishes a relationship with "ProductCategory" through the category_id field, which is of type ObjectId and refers to the "_id" field in the "ProductCategory" schema. This signifies a link between each product and a specific product category. The category_id in the "Product" schema acts as a foreign key connecting to the "ProductCategory" schema.


2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?

Ans. Validity in category assignment is guaranteed through MongoDB's referencing mechanism. In the "Product" schema, the category_id field, referencing 'ProductCategory', ensures that the assigned value corresponds to an existing "_id" in the "ProductCategory" collection. MongoDB inherently maintains referential integrity, allowing only valid categories to be associated with products. It is recommended to implement an application-level validation step to confirm the existence of the specified category before creating or updating a product.
